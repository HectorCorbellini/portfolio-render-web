# IMPROVEMENTS

**Date:** 2025-05-17  
**Time:** 01:43:44 -03:00

This document outlines the recent enhancements made to the portfolio project:

- **Updated demoPath values** in `src/data/projects.ts` to point to local directories under `/root/EMPREND/projects`.
- **Created backend** (`server.js`) using Express and CORS:
  - Exposed POST `/api/open` endpoint that invokes `xdg-open` to launch the specified project folder.
- **Installed dependencies**: `express`, `cors`.
- **Enhanced frontend logic** in `src/components/Projects/ProjectsSection.tsx`:
  - Replaced placeholder `launchDemo` with an async function that POSTs to `http://localhost:3001/api/open`.
- **Added npm script** in `package.json`:
  - `server` to run the Express backend

## Latest Improvements (2025-05-17)

### Server-Side Code Refactoring

The portfolio application's server-side code has been refactored to improve maintainability and scalability. The key changes include:

#### 1. Modular Demo Handler Architecture

- **New File**: Created `demoHandlers.js` to encapsulate demo launch logic
- **Reusable Functions**:
  - `launchJavaApp`: Handles Java JAR file execution with configurable arguments
  - `launchExecutable`: Manages native executable execution
- **Handler Registry**: Centralized mapping of project names to their launch functions

#### 2. Simplified Server Code

- **Refactored `/api/open` Endpoint**:
  - Removed repetitive conditional logic
  - Added simple handler lookup mechanism
  - Improved error handling and response consistency
- **Better Code Organization**:
  - Separated concerns between routing and execution
  - Made the code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Improved extensibility for adding new demo types

#### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Consistent Error Responses**: Standardized error message format across all handlers
- **Improved Logging**: Added more detailed logging for debugging
- **Better Error Recovery**: More robust error handling for process execution

### Frontend Error Handling Improvements

The frontend error handling has been enhanced with:

#### 1. Toast Notifications

- Replaced simple alerts with toast notifications using react-toastify
- Notifications appear in the top-right corner
- Auto-close after 5 seconds
- Better visual feedback for user actions

#### 2. Error Boundary Implementation

- Added React Error Boundary component
- Catches and handles runtime errors in React components
- Provides a fallback UI with reload option
- Shows toast notifications on errors

#### 3. Consistent Error Message Format

- Standardized error message format across the application
- Better user feedback for failed operations
- Clear indication of error recovery options

### Benefits of the Improvements

- **Better User Experience**: More elegant error notifications
- **Improved Error Recovery**: Better handling of runtime errors
- **Consistent Feedback**: Standardized error message format
- **Better Error Reporting**: More informative error messages
- **Improved Maintainability**: Better organized error handling code

### Configuration Management Improvements

- **Centralized Config**: Introduced `config.js` for centralizing paths and settings
- **Constants Defined**: `baseDir`, `appsDir`, `distDir`, `filesDir`, `defaultOpenCommand`, `demos`
- **Code Update**: Replaced hardcoded paths in `server.js` and `demoHandlers.js` with config values
- **Outcome**: Improved flexibility and maintainability
